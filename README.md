# 100 Days of Code – Python (Angela Yu)

This repository contains my completed projects, exercises, and notes from  
**Angela Yu’s “100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp”**.

I am documenting each day’s progress as part of my journey toward becoming a  
**Backend + Systems Engineer** with strong fundamentals in Python, programming, and problem-solving.

## 📈 Current Progress

I am currently on **Day 45 / 100**.

Here is a quick progress snapshot:

| Days       | Status        |
|-----------:|---------------|
| 001–010    | ✅ Completed   |
| 011–020    | ✅ Completed   |
| 021–030    | ✅ Completed   |
| 031–040    | ✅ Completed   |
| 041–050    | 🔄 In progress |
| 051–100    | ⏳ Planned     |

I started uploading my work to GitHub from Day 45 onward, and I am now adding previous days (1–44) as well.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day of the course has its own folder:

```text
day_001/
day_002/
...
day_045/
day_046/
...
day_100/
````

Inside each folder you may find:

* Python files for that day’s project
* Supporting files (data, text files, etc.)
* A project-specific README (for larger projects)

---

### 📝 Example (Day 45 – Web Scraping)

```text
day_045/
  main.py
  ordered_list.txt
  README.md
```

This project scraped data from a website using **BeautifulSoup**, processed it, and saved it into a text file.

---

## 🧠 Daily Workflow

For each day of the challenge, I try to:

1. Complete the lesson for that day
2. Build the project using Python
3. Test and refine the code
4. Add the files into the correct `day_0xx` folder
5. Commit with a descriptive message
6. Push to GitHub to maintain a public learning trail

Example commit message:

```text
Day 45: Web scraping project using BeautifulSoup
```

## 🎯 Goals for This Repository

* Build a strong, consistent Python foundation
* Improve Git and GitHub skills through real practice
* Track progress toward backend + systems engineering roles
* Develop a portfolio of real, working Python projects
* Cultivate discipline through daily coding

---

## 🔭 Next Steps

* Upload past days (1–44)
* Complete Days 46–100
* Start backend frameworks (Django / FastAPI)
* Begin deeper systems engineering courses (CS50, Nand2Tetris, CMU-213, etc.)
* Build portfolio-ready backend projects

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python 3.x
* BeautifulSoup (web scraping)
* Git & GitHub
* Windows environment
* (More tools will be added as I progress through the roadmap)

---

## ✨ Final Note

This repository is a core part of my long-term **software engineering roadmap**.
It represents consistent effort, real projects, and the discipline required to build a strong engineering career.

If you're following along or using this as inspiration — keep coding every day 🚀
